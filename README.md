- check node availability

- in order to remind you about the internet connection error experience, check out the below error snapshot

```
nest --version
```
- so my version is `8.2.5`
- `nest new nest-rest-api`

- after running the above command it asked if `npm/yarn/others` - I chose `yarn` because I trust `codewithharry` and `vincent`

![selected yarn as package manager](https://github.com/anindameister/learningNestJS/blob/main/photos/3.PNG)

- now while commiting the code, got an error because the `.git` file also exists within the `nest-rest-api` folder
- in order to fix the problem, decided to get rid of the `.git` file inside `nest-rest-api` .. That didn't work because vscode is open. Let me close the vscode and try again. Got to take shortcuts if I have to finish fast as ordered by Vincent.
